Othello is a strategy board game for two players, played on a checkered board.
There are sixty-four identical game pieces called disks, which are one color on
one side and another color on the other. Players take turns placing disks on the
board with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any disks of the opponent's
color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk
 of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color.

The object of the game is to have the majority of disks turned to display your color
when the last playable empty square is filled.
